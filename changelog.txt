- Cache for Album Data and User Favorites/Playlists:
  - Only the album data contains the correct release dates of the Albums. To display the correct
    release year of each Track the Album Data has to be read for each Track item.
  - The album data is saved into the SQLite Database "metaCache.db" in the Addons UserData folder.
  - Using parallel HTTP requests to read album data from TIDAL.
    The first request of a Tack List can take more time because the Album Cache is empty at begin !
    But Caution: Too Many Requests can cause a lock on the TIDAL Server for a few minutes !

- Shortcuts to be used as Actions in keyboard.xml or remote.xml:
  Examples:
  * Clear / Reload Cache for Favorites and User Playlists:
